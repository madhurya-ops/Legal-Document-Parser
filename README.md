## Overview

This application aims to streamline the process of analyzing legal documents by employing **Generative AI** (LLM) to extract key clauses, obligations, penalties, and dates from complex legal texts. The platform lets users upload documents, parses their content, and then utilizes a large language model to generate simplified explanations and highlight crucial information, all within a convenient and user-friendly web application.
