## Overview

This application aims to streamline the process of analyzing legal documents by employing **Generative AI** (LLM) to extract key clauses, obligations, penalties, and dates from complex legal texts. The platform lets users upload documents, parses their content, and then utilizes a large language model to generate simplified explanations and highlight crucial information, all within a convenient and user-friendly web application.

## Objectives

### Save Time and Reduce Manual Effort
Our tool helps lawyers, paralegals, and business teams quickly extract and summarize key details from legal documents — freeing up their time for more important and strategic tasks instead of combing through large amounts of text.

### Make Legal Documents Easier to Understand
We aim to break down complex legal language into clear and simple explanations, making it easier for non-lawyers or business stakeholders to make-informed decisions without needing extensive legal expertise.

### Create a Flexible and Scalable Platform
Our solution is designed to work with different document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and across a range of legal sectors — ensuring that it can grow and adapt alongside your needs in the future.
